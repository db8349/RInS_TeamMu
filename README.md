# RInS_TeamMu
Add this repository to your ROS workspace under the `/src` folder so that your ROS workspace folder structure
should look like this:
```
├── build
├── devel
└── src
    └── RInS_TeamMu
        ├── exercise1
        └── task1
``` 

So the idea is that when you are working on your own projects or just testing you would put your package into `/src` so that it
doesn't get tracked, but when you work our robot code you can put it all in `/src/RInS_TeamMu`.

Basically just clone the git repository in the `/src`
